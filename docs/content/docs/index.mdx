## FAQ

Common questions you may encounter:

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why is the camera preview black?">
    Make sure you have granted camera permissions to your app. On iOS, check `Info.plist` for `NSCameraUsageDescription`. On Android, ensure
    you've requested `CAMERA` permission at runtime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I fix 'Camera session could not be started'?">
    This usually happens when another app is using the camera. Close other camera apps and try again. Also ensure you're not mounting
    multiple Camera components simultaneously.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use VisionCamera in Expo?">
    Yes! VisionCamera supports Expo with a config plugin. Add it to your `app.json` plugins array and run `expo prebuild`.

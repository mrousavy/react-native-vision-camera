To focus the camera to a specific point, simply use the Camera's [`focus(...)`](/docs/api/classes/Camera#focus) function:

```ts
await camera.current.focus({ x: tapEvent.x, y: tapEvent.y })
```

The focus function expects a [`Point`](/docs/api/interfaces/Point) parameter which represents the location relative to the Camera view where you want to focus the Camera to (in _points_). If you use [react-native-gesture-handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/), this will consist of the [`x`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/next/gesture-handlers/api/tap-gh/#x) and [`y`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/next/gesture-handlers/api/tap-gh/#y) properties of the tap event payload.

So for example, `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` will focus to the upper left corner, while `{ x: VIEW_WIDTH, y: VIEW_HEIGHT }` will focus to the bottom right corner.

Focussing adjusts auto-focus (AF) and auto-exposure (AE).

:::note
`focus(...)` will fail if the selected Camera device does not support focusing (see [`CameraDevice.supportsFocus`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraDevice#supportsfocus))

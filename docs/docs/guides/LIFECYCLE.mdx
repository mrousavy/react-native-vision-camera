## The `isActive` prop

The Camera's [`isActive`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#isactive) property can be used to _pause_ the session (`isActive={false}`) while still keeping the session "warm". This is more desirable than completely unmounting the camera, since _resuming_ the session (`isActive={true}`) will be **much faster** than re-mounting the camera view.

For example, you want to **pause the camera** when the user **navigates to another page** or **minimizes the app** since otherwise the camera continues to run in the background without the user seeing it, causing **significant battery drain**. Also, on iOS a green dot indicates the user that the camera is still active, possibly causing the user to raise privacy concerns. (See ["About the orange and green indicators in your iPhone status bar"](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211876))

For example, you might want to pause the Camera when the user minimizes the app ([`useAppState()`](https://github.com/react-native-community/hooks?tab=readme-ov-file#useappstate)) or navigates to a new screen ([`useIsFocused()`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-is-focused/)):

```tsx
function App() {
  const isFocused = useIsFocused()
  const appState = useAppState()
  const isActive = isFocused && appState === "active"

  return <Camera {...props} isActive={isActive} />
}
```

## Events

VisionCamera emits multiple lifecycle events inside a Camera session. In general, initialization happens first, and start/stop events are emitted later on in the timeline:

```mermaid
gitGraph LR:
  branch Camera
  checkout Camera
  commit id:" "

  checkout Time
  commit id:"  "
  commit id:"   "

  checkout Camera
  commit id:"onInitialized()"

  branch Preview
  checkout Preview
  commit id:"    "

  checkout Time
  commit id:"     "
  commit id:"      "

  checkout Camera
  commit id:"onStarted()"

  checkout Preview
  commit id:"onPreviewStarted()"

  checkout Time
  commit id:"      "
  commit id:"       "
  commit id:"        "
  commit id:"        "
  commit id:"         "
  commit id:"          "

  checkout Preview
  commit id:"onPreviewStopped()"

  checkout Camera
  commit id:"onStopped()"
```

### The `onInitialized` event

Once a Camera session has been initialized, the [`onInitialized`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#oninitialized) event will be fired.
All Camera functions (e.g. [`takePhoto()`](taking-photos)) will be available immediately after the `onInitialized` event has been fired.

The event will be fired everytime Camera outputs are re-created, which happens either if the [`device`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#device) changes or any output (e.g. [`photo`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#photo)) is toggled on/off.

### The `onStarted`/`onStopped` events

After the Camera session is initialized it might or might not start streaming - depending on whether [`isActive`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#isactive) is `true` or `false`.

- `isActive={true}`: The session will start streaming. Once it has started streaming the [`onStarted`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#onstarted) will be called.
- `isActive={false}`: The session will stop streaming and eventually call the [`onStopped`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#onstopped) event.

### The `onPreviewStarted`/`onPreviewStopped` events

Similar to the `onStarted`/`onStopped` events, [`onPreviewStarted`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#onpreviewstarted)/[`onPreviewStopped`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#onpreviewstopped) will be called when the Camera started or stopped streaming into the Preview View.

This might also happen when flipping Camera devices (e.g. from back -> front), as the Preview View momentarily stops streaming frames when switching devices.

### The `onError` event

If the Camera encounters a runtime error, the [`onError`](/docs/api/interfaces/CameraProps#onerror) event will be fired.
It contains a [`CameraRuntimeError`](/docs/api/classes/CameraRuntimeError) with a `code` and `message` that describe the error.

See ["Camera Errors"](errors) for more information.

## Interruptions

VisionCamera gracefully handles Camera interruptions such as incoming calls, phone overheating, a different app opening the Camera, etc., and will automatically resume the Camera once it becomes available again.

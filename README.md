### V3

You're looking at the V3 version of VisionCamera, which features a full rewrite on the Android codebase and a huge refactor on the iOS codebase. If you encounter issues on V3, you can also [downgrade to V2](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/tree/v2), which is still partially supported.

### Example

```tsx
function App() {
  const device = useCameraDevice('back')

  if (device == null) return <NoCameraErrorView />
  return (
    <Camera
      style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}
      device={device}
      isActive={true}
    />
  )
}
```

> See the [example](./package/example/) app
